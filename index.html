            <p>When beginning your journey into coding, you'll want to start with learning the basics of HTML and CSS.
                These two are key to developing a solid understanding that will aid in your future coding learnings.</p>
            <p>In this article, we will cover:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML;</li>
                <li>CSS;</li>
                <li>How to get started when you are a total newbie;</li>
                <li>Steps to succeed in your coding journey;</li>
                <li>How to submit your work for others to review.</li>

            <p>We highly recommend going through the Free Code Camp (FCC) curriculum in order to get a quick yet
                effective
                overview of HTML and CSS. This course is divided into super short lessions with corresponding
                challenges. Once you've completed the first Responsive Web Design certification challenges, you can
                refer to said completed challenges to help you when working on your projects.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of HTML code you will learn:</p>
            <code>
                    &lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
            </code>
            <p>And here's an example of CSS code:</p>
            <code>
                    body {
                        background-color: lightblue;
                      }
                      
                      h1 {
                        color: white;
                        text-align: center;
                      }
                      
                      p {
                        font-family: verdana;
                        font-size: 20px;
                      }
            </code>
            <p>Once you've finished the above-mentioned Free Code Camp certification, you'll be able to create:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A responsive web page;</li>
                <li>A form on your web page;</li>
                <li>Integrate flexboxes, media queries and other responsive features;</li>
                <li>plus much more!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Learning to code may seem overwhelming at first; that's why organizations like Free Code Camp exist! They
                set you up for success by creating a manageable curriculum that you can tackle at your own pace. There
                are other similar organizations that exist, and many tutorials on various tech websites. If you want to
                go a step further and fast-track your learning with professionals in the field, you can even sign up for
                bootcamps. Most major cities have private schools that specialize in this. There are even some you can
                do online. The downside is they cost quite a bit.
            </p>
            <p>That's why we recommend going with Free Code Camp. Many people have gone through the curriculum and
                found developer jobs afterwards.</p>
            <code>
                &lt;li&gt;This is how you add a list item&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;You would then add another list item.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;And continue until you're done.&lt;/li&gt;
            </code>
            <p>Reasons to learn code through a program like Free Code Camp:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It covers all the basics so you build future skills on solid knowledge.</li>
                <li>It offers over 6,000 tutioals.</li>
                <li>It's entirely FREE!</li>
                <li>They do ask for donations (I'll probably donate soon).</li>

            <p>Once you get in the rythm of doing the lessons and challenges, things should go fairly smoothly. There
                will be times, however, when you get frustrated. This is normal- don't give up! Every successful
                developer will tell you that the learning part never goes away. Development is a profession where you
                need to love life-long learning. It's the only way you will stay relevant. It's a fast-paced industry
                with new technologies emerging all the time, and staying up to date with them can be critical to your
                success. It's quite exciting if you enjoy the work!</p>
            <p>So how do you stick with it when it feels way too challenging at times?</p>
            <code>
              .main {
                background-color: black;
                text-align: center;
              }

              }
            </code>
            <p>Here are some ways to stay motivated and on track:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Limit yourself to x hours a day to work on the lessons. Don't overdo it.</li>
                <li>When you're mentally tired, put it away. Fresh eyes make a difference.</li>
                <li>When you're stuck on a problem, walk away from the computer for a bit.</li>
                <li>Connect with others through industry forums and the FCC community.</li>

                you have many avenues to try. The online world is your oyster when it comes to finding jobs. You can
                choose to work as a freelance developer or find a permanent position with all sorts of companies. Web
                developers are needed in almost every single industry.</p>
            <p>Here are some tips when job hunting:</p>

                <li>Be sure to have a complete LinkedIn profile;</li>
                <li>Create profiles on online developer communities like Github where you can share your code;</li>
                <li>Share on social media that you're looking for new work opportunities;</li>
